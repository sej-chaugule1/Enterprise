<h2> Why Extreme Education?</h2>

<div class="Why">
<p style = "display:inline-block">If you want your child to be best prepared to succeed both at school and beyond, Extreme Education learning systems make all the difference.</p>
<img src="Why.jpg">
<p style = "display:inline-block"> Extreme Education is a strong, flexible and dynamic learning system that focuses on the key Mathematics and English learning outcomes for the Australian Curriculum. More than just private tuition, our programmes help to form good study habits, increase self-confidence as students work out how to overcome challenges by themselves.</p>
<img src="Why1.jpg">
<p style = "display:inline-block">We believe that every child is different, and so their programme of study should be too. Our individualised programmes enable students to progress to an advanced level, at their own pace, so they can realise their potential and experience success.</p>
